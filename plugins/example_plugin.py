Example plugin for Lead Hunter Toolkit

This demonstrates the plugin API. Plugins can:
1. Add custom menu items to Streamlit app
2. Hook into workflow events
3. Extend functionality

To create a plugin:
1. Create a .py file in plugins/
2. Implement a register() function that returns metadata
3. Plugin will be auto-loaded on app start
